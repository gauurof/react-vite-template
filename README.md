# React + Vite Template

A minimal, modern, opinionated React foundation. It gives you a small, working baseline — React 19, Vite 8, strict TypeScript, Tailwind CSS v4, Vitest, and Oxc tooling — without imposing architecture on your app.

## 💡 Why this template?

- **Small by design.** The baseline contains only what every project needs to run, test, and build. Everything else is yours to add when (and if) your app needs it.
- **Opinionated defaults.** Strict TypeScript, type-aware linting, pinned toolchain versions, and a single `pnpm check` command that covers lint, format, types, tests, and dead-code detection.
- **Fast tooling.** The Oxc toolchain (oxlint + oxfmt) replaces the slower ESLint + Prettier setup, and Vite provides instant dev-server startup.
- **Easy to adopt.** Fork it, rename it, replace `src/App.tsx`, and start building.

## ✨ Features

- React 19 with `React.StrictMode`
- Vite 8 dev server and optimized production builds
- Strict TypeScript with a solution-style tsconfig (app + node projects)
- Tailwind CSS v4 via the `@tailwindcss/vite` plugin (CSS-first, no `tailwind.config.js`)
- Unit tests with Vitest, happy-dom, and Testing Library (plus jest-dom matchers)
- oxlint (type-aware) for linting and oxfmt for formatting
- knip to detect unused files, exports, and dependencies
- `@` path alias mapped to `src/` (Vite + tsconfig)
- pnpm with pinned Node 24.18.0 and pnpm 12.4.2 (`engines` + `engine-strict`)
- GitHub Actions CI running lint, format, typecheck, tests, and build as parallel jobs

## ✅ What's included?

- A working starter app: `src/main.tsx`, `src/App.tsx`, `src/index.css`
- A passing sample test (`src/App.test.tsx`) and Vitest setup (`src/test/setup.ts`)
- Build/test config: `vite.config.ts`, `vitest.config.ts`, solution-style `tsconfig.json` (references `tsconfig.app.json` + `tsconfig.node.json`)
- Tooling config: `.oxlintrc.json`, `.oxfmtrc.json`, `knip.json`
- Environment pinning: `.nvmrc`, `.npmrc` (`engine-strict=true`), `packageManager` field
- GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)
- Editor and editor experience: `.editorconfig`, `.vscode/settings.json`, `.vscode/extensions.json` (recommended: Tailwind CSS IntelliSense, Vitest, EditorConfig, Oxc)
- `LICENSE` (MIT) and a `public/` folder with `favicon.svg`

## 🚫 What's intentionally not included?

The template deliberately does **not** include:

- **React Router** — no client-side routing
- **Redux / Zustand** — no state-management library
- **TanStack Query** — no server-state / data-fetching cache
- **Axios** — no HTTP client (native `fetch` is available)
- **Storybook** — no component workshop
- **Playwright** — no end-to-end test setup
- **UI framework** — no component library (plain Tailwind CSS only)
- **Authentication** — no auth or session handling
- **Backend** — no API, database, or server code

These are deliberately omitted to keep the foundation small. A minimal baseline is easier to understand, audit, and customize — and every one of the above can be added later with `pnpm add` once your application actually needs it.

## 🚀 Getting started

Prerequisites:

- Node.js **24.18.0** (pinned in `.nvmrc` and `engines.node`)
- pnpm **12.4.2** (pinned via `packageManager` in `package.json`)

Enable Corepack (bundled with Node.js 24) to get the pinned pnpm version automatically:

```bash
corepack enable
pnpm install
pnpm run dev
```

The dev server is available at `http://localhost:5173`.

Notes:

- `engines` + `.npmrc` (`engine-strict=true`) make pnpm fail fast on a Node/pnpm version mismatch.
- Install `node_modules` on the OS where you run the project — platform-specific native binaries (oxlint, oxfmt, esbuild) are not portable between Windows, WSL, and Linux. If you switch OS, delete `node_modules` and run `pnpm install` again.

## 📦 Why pnpm?

This template uses pnpm instead of npm for three reasons:

- **Fast, disk-efficient installs** — pnpm keeps packages in a global content-addressable store and hard-links them into `node_modules`, so installs are quick even when projects share dependencies.
- **Strict dependency model** — only explicitly declared dependencies are reachable from your code, which prevents silently relying on transitive ("phantom") packages.
- **Consistency** — the pnpm version is pinned via the `packageManager` field in `package.json` (picked up automatically by Corepack) and `engines`, so local development and CI always use the same version.

If you prefer npm, you can switch package managers, but this template is tested and maintained with pnpm.

## ⌨️ Available commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `pnpm run dev` | Start the Vite dev server |
| `pnpm run build` | Type-check (`tsc -b`) and build for production into `dist/` |
| `pnpm run preview` | Serve the production build locally |
| `pnpm run check` | Run lint, format check, typecheck, tests, and knip |
| `pnpm run lint` | Lint `src/` with oxlint |
| `pnpm run lint:fix` | Lint `src/` with oxlint and auto-fix |
| `pnpm run format` | Format `src/` with oxfmt |
| `pnpm run format:check` | Fail on files that need formatting |
| `pnpm run typecheck` | Type-check all projects with `tsc -b` |
| `pnpm run test` | Run the test suite with Vitest |
| `pnpm run test:coverage` | Run the test suite with coverage (`@vitest/coverage-v8`) |
| `pnpm run fix` | `lint:fix` followed by `format` |
| `pnpm run knip` | Detect unused files, exports, and dependencies |

## 🧪 Testing

- **Vitest** runs in the **happy-dom** environment
- **@testing-library/react** for rendering and querying components
- **@testing-library/jest-dom** adds DOM matchers (loaded via `src/test/setup.ts`, which also runs `cleanup` after each test)
- Coverage is available with `pnpm run test:coverage`

```bash
pnpm run test
```

`src/App.test.tsx` contains a sample test you can use as a starting point.

## 🔍 Code quality

The template uses the **Oxc** toolchain instead of ESLint + Prettier:

- **oxlint** — type-aware linting with the `unicorn`, `typescript`, `oxc`, `react`, `jsx-a11y`, and `vitest` plugins (see `.oxlintrc.json`)
- **oxfmt** — code formatting (see `.oxfmtrc.json`)
- **knip** — detects unused files, exports, dependencies, and devDependencies

TypeScript runs in `strict` mode with additional strictness flags (`noUncheckedIndexedAccess`, `exactOptionalPropertyTypes`, `noImplicitOverride`, ...) in `tsconfig.app.json`.

Run everything at once:

```bash
pnpm run check
```

└── vitest.config.ts           # Merges vite.config.ts, happy-dom + setup file
```

The `@` alias points to `src/` (configured in `vite.config.ts` and `tsconfig.app.json`):

```ts
import { App } from "@/App";
```

Organize `src/` however your app needs — the template only requires that entry and test files stay where the config expects them.

## 🎨 Customizing the template

1. Rename the package (`name` in `package.json`) and update the title/description in `index.html`.
2. Replace `src/App.tsx` with your application.
3. Add libraries with `pnpm add <package>` when your app needs them (routing, state management, data fetching, UI, E2E, etc.).
4. Keep `pnpm check` green as you grow the codebase.

## 🔄 Updating dependencies

- `pnpm update` — update dependencies within their semver ranges
- `pnpm update --latest` — jump to the latest major versions, then review breaking changes
- Node and pnpm versions are pinned in `engines`, `.nvmrc`, and the `packageManager` field. To change them, update all three together; Corepack will pick up the new pnpm version from `packageManager`.
